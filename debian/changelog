crash (6.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 6.0.2
  * Implemention of a new "arguments-input-file" feature, where an input file
    containing crash command arguments may be iteratively fed to a crash
    command.  For each line of arguments in an input file, the selected crash
    command will be executed.  
  * Many thanks to Josef Bacik for proposing this feature.
  * Fix for the "runq" command for kernels configured with
    CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED.  Without the patch, it is possible that a task
    may be listed twice in a cpu's CFS runqueue.
  * Fix for the internal parse_line() function to properly handle the case
    where the first argument in a line is a string argument that is
    encapulated with quotation marks.
  * Fix for the usage of gzip'd vmlinux file that was compressed with "gzip
    -n" or "gzip --no-name" without using "-f" on the command line.  Without
    the patch, the crash session fails with an error message that indicates
    "crash: <string-containing-garbage>: compressed file name does not start
    with vmlinux".  With the patch, if such a file is used without "-f", it
    will be accepted with a message that indicates that the original filename
    is unknown, and a suggestion that "-f" be used to prevent the message.
  * Added a new "mod -g" option that enhances the symbol display for kernel
    modules.  After loading a module's debuginfo data, the module object's
    section addresses will be shown as pseudo-symbols.
  * Fix for the "gdb" command to prevent the option handling of command lines.
    Without the patch, a gdb command string that contained a "-<character>"
    pair preceded by whitespace, would fail with the error message "gdb: gdb:
    invalid option -- <character>".
  * Fix for the panic-task determination if a dumpfile is taken on a system
    that actually has a cpu count that is equal to its per-arch NR_CPUS value.
    Without the patch, the task running on the cpu whose number is equal to
    NR_CPUS-1 would be selected.
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command to handle a recursive entry into the NMI
    exception stack.  While this should normally never happen, it is possible
    if, for example, a kprope is entered into a function that gets executed
    during NMI handling, and a second NMI is received after the initial one,
    corrupting the original exception frame at the top of the NMI stack.
    Without the patch, the NMI stack backtrace and exception frame would be
    displayed repeatedly; with the patch, the backtrace and exception frame
    are followed by the warning message "NMI exception stack recursion: prior
    stack location overwritten".
  * Support dumpfiles that are created by the PPC64 Firmware Assisted Dump
    facility, also known as "fadump" or "FAD".  Without the patch, the panic
    task cannot be determined from a fadump vmcore which was subsequently
    compressed with makedumpfile, and therefore a proper backtrace of the
    panic task cannot be generated.
  * Preparation for new s390x kernels that will increase MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS from
    42 to 46.

crash (6.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 6.0.1
  * Several fixes/updates for the 32-bit PPC architecture: (1) Delete
    "__func__.<number>" symbols from the symbol list.  (2) Update manner of
    determining the processor speed displayed by the initial system banner and
    the "sys" command.  (3) Use the kernel's online cpus mask for determining
    the cpu count.  (4) Enable the "bt" command to follow traces that start in
    a per-cpu IRQ stack.  (5) Fix for the "bt" command to better prevent
    runaway stack traces.  (6) Fix for the "bt" command to recognize/display
    2.6 kernel exception frames.  (7) Update "bt" command's exception frame
    register display.  (8) Implement "bt -f" option.
  * Fix for the X86 kernel module line-number capability on some kernels.  It
    is unclear why only some kernel versions exhibit this problem, but the
    newly-embedded gdb version 7.3.1 has changed behaviour such that the
    addrmap arrays of module text address blocks may contain the module text
    offset values instead of their loaded vmalloc addresses, and so without
    the patch, there is no "match" for the vmalloc address when searching for
    its line number information.  It is fixed by doing a preliminary symbol
    search before accessing the line-number access routine.
  * Fix for the X86_64 kernel module line-number capability on kernels that
    have functions preceded by the __vsyscall_fn macro, which puts the kernel
    text function in the vsyscall page that starts at virtual address
    0xffffffffff600000.  This results in a text address block that starts at a
    normal kernel text address but ends with a vsyscall address, which
    inadvertently contains the whole vmalloc address range.  Without the
    patch, line number requests for module vmalloc text addresses would be
    mistakenly issued the first text section that ended with a vsyscall
    address, but then cannot find line number information in that section.
  * Fix for the inadvertent patching of the symbols of the 32-bit Xen
    hypervisor binary.  Without the patch, during initialization the
    minimal_symbols are "patched" with their original values, so they remain
    unchanged, and the message "WARNING: kernel relocated [0MB]: patching 3434
    gdb minimal_symbol values" is displayed.
  * If the "--mod <directory-tree>" command line option, or the setting of the
    CRASH_MODULE_PATH environment variable, or the "mod -S <directory-tree>"
    point to a tree that contains only the separate debuginfo
    "<module>.ko.debug" files, then those debuginfo files will be used as the
    internal "add-symbol-file" arguments to the embedded gdb module.  Without
    the patch, it was only acceptable to point to a directory tree that
    contained the base "<module>.ko" files, and the separate debuginfo files
    were found automatically based upon the directory path to the base module
    file.  This will allow an alternate module-debuginfo directory tree to be
    set up like so: # cd <directory> # rpm2cpio kernel-debuginfo-<release>.rpm
    | cpio -idv Having done that, the <directory> may be used with the
    "--mod", command line argument, or as the CRASH_MODULE_PATH environment
    variable, or as the "mod -S <directory> argument.
  * Make the suspension of the verbose/time-consuming "sym -l" output
    immediate upon the killing of the output pipe, or the entry of the first
    CTRL-c.  Without the patch, it would typically take several seconds, or
    multiple CTRL-c entries, for the "crash>" prompt to be re-displayed.
  * Fix for the handling of piped commands if the command receiving the crash
    output is non-existent or invalid.  Without the patch, the crash command
    would wait indefinitely unless multiple CTRL-c entries were entered. 
  * Fix for the s390x "bt" command's floating point register display header.
    Without the patch, the header indicates that only registers 0, 2, 4 and 6
    are printed, a relic of the s390 architecture, whereas on the s390x all
    floating point registers are displayed.          
  * Fix for the error message displayed when an untrusted .gdbinit file exists
    in the current directory.  Without the patch, the error message "WARNING:
    not using untrusted file: " would be followed by garbage ASCII data
    instead of the full pathname of the .gdbinit file.
  * Fix for the "kmem -p" and "kmem -i" commands in 3.1 and later kernels
    where the page structure's "_count" member was moved into an embedded
    anonymous structure.  Without the patch, the commands fail with the error
    message "kmem: invalid structure member offset: page_count FILE: memory.c
    LINE: 4610  FUNCTION: dump_mem_map_SPARSEMEM()".
  * Allow the user to append data to the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables in the
    top-level Makefile.  The extra data should be put in files named
    "CFLAGS.extra" and "LDFLAGS.extra" in the top-level directory; if either
    or both files exist, the extra data within them will be appended to the
    relevant variable.  Typically the LDFLAGS.extra file will contain
    "-l<library>" strings, and the CFLAGS.extra file will contain "-D<value>"
    strings.  This will allow the crash utility to be built with optional
    libraries, and the code that references them to be encapsulated with
    associated "#ifdef <value>" sections.  The extra CFLAGS data will also be
    passed to extension modules that are built within the local
    "crash-<version>/extensions" subdirectory.
  * The LDFLAGS setting in the Makefile can no longer be modified by hand.  It
    will be automatically configured by the "configure -b" option, based upon
    the contents of the optional "LDFLAGS.extra" file.
  * Fix for the "runq" command to display the runnable tasks that are
    contained within a cgroup's task-group scheduling entity.  Without the
    patch, only scheduling entities that are individual tasks get displayed,
    and runnable tasks in task-group scheduling entities get skipped.
  * Fix for the SIAL extension module when repeatedly loading and unloading a
    sial script when a full pathname is specified for the script.  Without the
    patch, the 4th unload attempt generates a segmentation violation. 
  * Fix for the SIAL extension module to register the help and usage functions
    for a command only when loading a script.

crash (6.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 6.0.0
  * Depend on binutils  (close: #645124)
  * Updated the embedded gdb version to FSF gdb-7.3.1.  This change is
    required for kernels built with gcc-4.6.1, which now defaults to using
    -gdwarf-4.  When using prior versions of crash on such a vmlinux file, it
    fails immediately with the message "Dwarf Error: wrong version in
    compilation unit header (is 4, should be 2) [in module vmlinux]" followed
    by "crash: vmlinux: no debugging data available".  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Incremental patch for the SADUMP dumpfile support that was introduced in
    crash-5.1.8.  The patchset fixes minor bugs, cleans up the sadump module,
    addresses the issue of gathering the first 640KB backup from a
    kdump-enabled kernel, prepares for makedumpfile's support of the SADUMP
    format, and has "bt" display the stored register set when the compressed
    kdump was generated from an SADUMP dumpfile.  (d.hatayama@jp.fujitsu.com)
  * Fix for the "gdb" command, or any command that resolves to a gdb command,
    to allow redirection to a pipe or file.  This addresses a regression that
    was introduced by an unrelated "gdb" command fix in crash-5.1.4 that
    prevented the stripping of quotation marks from the input line.  Without
    the patch, redirection of a "gdb" command to a pipe or file fails with the
    error message "gdb: gdb request failed:
    <original-command-line-including-redirection>".  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for live system analysis of 32-bit PPC kernels.  Without the patch,
    the session would fail after displaying the error message: WARNING:
    machine type mismatch: crash utility: PPC vmlinux: (unknown)
    (nakayama.ts@ncos.nec.co.jp)
  * Fix to allow vmalloc memory access on 32-bit PPC kernels.  Without the
    patch, the warning message "WARNING: cannot access vmalloc'd module
    memory" would be displayed during invocation, and kernel virtual memory
    that was vmalloc'd could not be accessed.  (nakayama.ts@ncos.nec.co.jp)
  * Fix to correctly gather task addresses from 32-bit PPC kernels.  Without
    the patch, during invocation a stream of error messages indicating "crash:
    invalid task address in pid_hash: <address>" would be displayed.
    (nakayama.ts@ncos.nec.co.jp)
  * Fix for the "bt" command in 32-bit PPC kernels.  Without the patch, the
    "bt" command would generate a segmentation violation.

crash (5.1.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.1.9
  * Fixed the compressed kdump panic task determination function to use the
    kernel's "crashing_cpu" symbol if it exists.  Without the patch, the
    function returned 0 because it was using diskdump-specific header
    variables that are always set to zero in compressed kdump dumpfiles; the
    panic task was then found by searching the kernel stacks of all of the
    active tasks.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the potential of false-positive warning messages during the
    initialization of s390x zdump dumpfiles that would indicate either
    "WARNING: multiple active tasks have called die and/or panic" and/or
    "WARNING: multiple active tasks have called die".
    (holzheu@linux.vnet.ibm.com)
  * Removal of superfluous code for gathering registers from the ELF header in
    the ARM get_netdump_regs_arm() function.  (per.fransson.ml@gmail.com)
  * Additional fixes for the ARM architecture gdb-7.0/bfd/elf32-arm.c and
    gdb-7.0/bfd/cpu-arm.c files to handle gcc-4.6 compiler failures.  Without
    the patch, gcc-4.6 generates "error: variable ‘<variable>’ set but not
    used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" fatal errors when the (default)
    -Werror flag is used.  Previous gcc versions considered local variables
    were simply set to some value to be "used", but that is no longer the
    case.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Added new "dis -[xd]" options, which override the current default output
    format with hexadecimal or decimal format for just the command instance.
    Without the patch, it would require changing the default output format
    with "hex" or "dec" prior to executing "dis".  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Added new "task -[xd]" options, which override the current default output
    format with hexadecimal or decimal format for just the command instance.
    Without the patch, it would require changing the default output format
    with "hex" or "dec" prior to executing "task".  The new flags may be used
    with "foreach task" as well.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Prevent the "struct -[xd]", "union -[xd]", and "p -[xd]" commands from
    allowing both options being entered on the command line.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fixes to top-level crash source files filesys.c, memory.c, netdump.c,
    sadump.c, symbols.c, x86.c and lkcd_x86_trace.c to allow them to be
    compiled cleanly with gcc-4.6.  Without the patch, gcc-4.6 generates fatal
    errors indicating "error: variable ‘<variable>’ set but not used
    [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" when building crash with "make Warn",
    or generates similar warning messages when building with "make warn".
    This has been tested only on x86, x86_64 and ARM; the other architectures
    may still generate errors/warnings when compiling their machine-specific
    files with gcc-4.6.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the "irq" command on 2.6.39 and later kernels.  Without the patch,
    the command fails with the message "irq: invalid structure member offset:
    irq_desc_t_status".  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the SIAL extension module that solves the problem of getting
    access to integer variables.  (makc@gmx.co.uk)
  * Fix for compiler warnings when building the extensions/sial.so extension
    module with recent versions of /usr/bin/ld.  Without the patch, two
    warning messages are displayed:  "/usr/bin/ld: Warning: alignment 4 of
    symbol 'sialppdebug' in /tmp/ccYSzE2s.o is smaller than 16 in
    libsial/libsial.a(sialpp.tab.o)" and "/usr/bin/ld: Warning: alignment 4 of
    symbol 'sialdebug' in /tmp/ccYSzE2s.o is smaller than 16 in
    libsial/libsial.a(sial.tab.o)".  (maxc@gmx.co.uk)
  * If the stack pointer found in the register set stored in the ELF header of
    a compressed kdump dumpfile, a KVM dumpfile, or an SADUMP dumpfile is
    either NULL or cannot be accessed, the register set will be dumped after
    the error message.  Without the patch, only the error message was
    displayed.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Preparation of the top-level crash sources for more efficient updates of
    the embedded gdb version.  The changes should be invisible other than the
    fact that all top-level source files will now be compiled with the
    -DGDB_xxx flag, because the gdb-defined TYPE_CODE_xxx values that are
    exported in defs.h changed in more recent gdb versions.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fixes for potential segmentation violations during the panic task search
    phase of session initialization from a version 4 or later x86_64
    compressed kdump, in which the number of ELF NT_PRSTATUS notes in the
    dumpfile does not match the number of cpus running when the system
    crashed.  (Joe.Lawrence@stratus.com, anderson@redhat.com)
  * Created an exported set_tmpfile2() function that allows the caller to pass
    in their own FILE pointer of an open file that only exists during the
    execution of a command.  It will afford the recursive-use protection of
    open_tmpfile2() plus the automatic closure of the file if the command
    fails prior to completion or if the user forgets to close it with
    close_tmpfile2().  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Created a new "rd -r <outputfile>" option that copies raw data from memory
    to an output file.  It can be invoked either of two possible manners:
     crash> rd -r <outputfile> <address> <count>
     crash> rd -r <outputfile> <address> -e <ending-address
    The <count> value is always a byte count with this option.
    (adrian.wenl@gmail.com, anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the ARM "bt" command to store the correct value of the fp register
    of active tasks.  Without the patch, in rare circumstances, the output may
    show an empty backtrace.  (per.xx.fransson@stericsson.com)
  * Fix to prevent a harmless warning message when /proc/kallsyms is used as a
    mapfile argument.  Without the patch, during initialization, the message
    "crash: /proc/kallsyms: lseek: Invalid argument" is       displayed.  If a
    regular file copy of /proc/kallsyms is used, the message is not displayed.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for running against live x86 kernels that have been relocated by the
    Intel Trusted Boot or "tboot" facility.  Without the patch, a live crash
    session fails during invocation with the error message "crash: vmlinux and
    /dev/mem do not match!" (or "/dev/crash" if applicable).  As a
    work-around, "/proc/kallsyms" can be entered on the command line, or the
    "--reloc=<size>" option can be used, but this fix obviates that
    requirement for live systems.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the unlikely event where makedumpfile-generated s390/s390x
    compressed kdumps do not have a CPU count in the dumpfile header.  This
    can happen when older s390 dump tools are used to create a dump that do
    not write the CPU information into the s390 dump header.  Without the
    patch, the warning message "crash: compressed kdump: invalid nr_cpus: 0"
    is displayed, the dumpfile is not recognized as a compressed kdump, and
    the session fails.  Since s390/s390x have a fallback function that gets
    the CPU register information out of memory, the same warning message will
    be displayed, but the dumpfile will still be recognized as a compressed
    kdump.  (holzheu@linux.vnet.ibm.com)
  * Fix for the "net -s" command on 2.6.38 and later kernels.  Without the
    patch, the command fails with the error message "net: invalid structure
    member offset: inet_opt_daddr".  (bob.montgomery@hp.com,

crash (5.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added explicit build-dep for dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.1) to resolve the "set but
    unused" errors. 
  * New upstream version 5.1.8
  * Fixes for gdb-7.0 ppc64/ppc-specific files to handle gcc-4.6 compiler
    failures.  Without the patch, gcc-4.6 generates "error: variable
    ‘<variable>’ set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" fatal
    errors when the (default) -Werror flag is used.  Previous gcc versions
    considered local variables were simply set to some value to
  * Add support for the "bt" command to recognize the new s390x
    "restart_stack" used by the PSW restart interrupt in 3.0.1 and later
    kernels. 
  * Enhancement to the s390x "bt" command to display the register contents of
    the pt_regs strucutre for interrupts, instead of just printing the string
    "- Interrupt -".  The pt_regs structure contains all of the current
    registers and PSW of the interrupted CPU.
  * Removed the "files -l" option, which does not support 2.6 or later
    kernels, and because it requires structure offset data that can only be
    determined if the "lockd" and "nfsd" modules have been built into the
    kernel.  Given the kernel module dependencies, the command is more
    suitable as an extension module, if anyone cares to carry on its legacy.
  * Fix for the "ps" command to disallow the mutually-exclusive "-u" and "-k"
    options from being entered together.  Without the patch, whichever of the
    two options was entered last was acted upon.  Also, the help page was
    clarified by separating the three process identifier formats from the
    "-u", "-k" and "-G" qualifiers.
  * Fix for the "ps" command to disallow the mutually-exclusive "-a", "-t",
    "-c", "-p", "-g", "-l" and "-r" options from being entered together.
    Without the patch, whichever of the seven options that was entered last
    was acted upon.
  * Added new "struct -[xd]" and "union -[xd]" options, which override the
    current default output format with hexadecimal or decimal format for just
    the command instance.  The "-o" member offset values and the structure
    size value are also controlled by the new options.  Without the patch, it
    would require changing the default output format with "hex" or "dec" prior
    to executing the "struct" or "union" command.
  * Fix for the "fuser" command, which may occasionally precede its output
    with the message "WARNING: FILE_NRHASH has changed from 32" on 2.6.19 and
    later kernels.  The message is harmless.
  * Exported new set_temporary_radix() and restore_current_radix() functions,
    which are used to temporarily override the current output radix setting.
  * Fixes for ARM gdb-7.0/bfd/elf32-arm.c file to handle gcc-4.6 compiler
    failures.  Without the patch, gcc-4.6 generates "error: variable
    ‘<variable>’ set but not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" fatal
    errors when the (default) -Werror flag is used.  Previous gcc versions
    considered local variables were simply set to some value to be "used", but
    that is no longer the case.
  * Cosmetic fix for command-failure "Usage" messages to prevent the output
    from exceeding 80 columns.
  * Implemented a new "struct -p" option which can be used to dereference
    pointer members and display the target data.  The option can be used with
    the struct_name.member[,member] format, or if not, all pointers in the
    structure will be dereferenced.  If the member is a pointer, the member's
    data type will be prepended to the member name when displaying the target
    address; on the subsequent line(s) the target's symbol name will be
    displayed in brackets if appropriate, and if possible, the target data
    will be displayed.  
  * Implemented support for "SADUMP" dumpfiles, which are created by the
    Fujitsu Stand Alone Dump facility.  The dump-creation mechanism is based
    in hardware-specific firmware, generating a dumpfile in three different
    formats: sadump dump device (single partition), sadump dump device (disk
    set), and archive file formats.  The crash utility recognizes all three
    formats.
  * Fix for the "bt" command to display Control registers 8-15 (s390x and
    s390) and floating point registers 8-15 (s390x only) correctly.  Without
    the patch, the register content was copied from the wrong location of the
    save area, and the wrong register values were displayed for the active
    tasks.
  * Fix for 2.6.34 ppc64 kernels, which were changed to dynamically allocate
    the paca structure, and changed the data type of "paca" symbol from array
    to a paca_struct pointer. 
  * Fix for 2.6.36 and later ppc64 kernels, which overwrite the paca pointer
    variable to point to a static paca during a crash sequence just prior to
    the kexec of the secondary kernel, which contains a
    paca_struct.data_offset value that is valid only for crashing cpu.
    However, the kernel change also re-introduced the  __per_cpu_offset array,
    which had been removed in 2.6.15, which will be used as an alternative to
    the per-cpu paca_struct.
  * The new version of makedumpfile, 1.4.0, contains a facility that allows a
    user to filter out kernel data (e.g., security keys, confidential/secret
    information, etc.) from a vmcore.  The data that is filtered out is
    poisoned with character 'X' (0x58).  A filtered ELF kdump vmcore now
    contains a new "ERASEINFO" ELF note section that contains the filter data
    strings used by makedumpfile.  A filtered compressed kdump has a header
    version number 5, and contains new offset_eraseinfo and size_eraseinfo
    members in its sub-header that point to a copy of the filter data strings.
    In most cases, the erased kernel data will be inconsequential to the crash
    session, but it is certainly possible that the removal of crucial kernel
    data that the crash utility needs may cause the crash session to fail,
    cause individual commands to fail, or result in other unpredictable
    runtime behaviour.  This patch detects whether kernel data has been erased
    from the dumpfile, and if so, displays an early warning message alerting
    the user.  The "help -n" command displays the filter data strings that
    were used by makedumpfile.

crash (5.1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.1.7
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command in the highly-unlikely event that a
    non-crashing CPU receives a NMI immediately after receiving an interrupt
    from another source in a 2.6.29 and later kernel.  In those kernels, the
    IRQ entry-point symbols "IRQ0x00_interrupt" through "IRQ0x##_interrupt" no
    longer exist, but the entry points exist as memory locations starting at
    the symbol "irq_entries_start".  Without the patch, if a shutdown NMI
    interrupt gets received while in one of the entry point stubs, "bt" will
    fail with the error message "bt: cannot transition from exception stack to
    current process stack".
  * The x86 and x86_64 "bt -e" and "bt -E" commands will display symbolic
    translations of kernel-mode exception RIP values.
  * Clarified two initialization-time CRASHDEBUG(1) messages to make it
    obvious that the two linux_banner strings being compared originate from
    the memory source or the kernel namelist file.
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to handle cases where the shutdown NMI was
    received when a task had just completed an exception, interrupt, or signal
    handler, and was about to return to user-space.  Without the patch, the
    backtrace would be proceeded with the error message "bt: cannot resolve
    stack trace", display the trace without the kernel-entry exception frame,
    and then dump the text symbols found on the stack and all possible
    exception frames.
  * Fix for 2.6.33 and later kernels that are not configured CONFIG_SMP.
    Without the patch, they fail during initialization with the error message
    "crash: invalid structure member offset: module_percpu".
  * Prepare for the imminent change in size of the vm_flags member of the
    vm_area_struct to be 64-bits in size for all architectures now that 32
    bits have been consumed.  The crash utility code had been handling the
    older change of the vm_flags member from a short to a long, but that would
    not account for the future change to a 64-bit member on 32-bit
    architectures. 
  * Update of the "vm -f <flags>" option to the current upstream state.
    Without the patch, only 23 of the currently-existing 32 bit flags were
    being translated.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the "kmem -s", "kmem -S", "kmem -s <address>" and "kmem <address>"
    command options if none of the NUMA nodes in in a multi-node CONFIG_SLAB
    system have a node ID of 0.  Without the patch, "kmem -s" and "kmem -S"
    show all slab caches as if they contain no slabs; if an <address> is
    specified, the correct slab cache is found, but the command indicates
    "kmem: <slab-cache-name>: address not found in cache: <address>".
  * Cosmetic fix for the "kmem -[sS]" options if a CONFIG_SLAB kernel slab
    cache contains 100000 or more slabs, or uses a slab size of 1 or more
    megabytes.  Without the patch, the output utilizes more than 80 columns. 
  * If a task was in user-space when a crash occurred, the user-space
    registers are saved in per-cpu NT_PRSTATUS ELF notes in either version 4
    compressed kdump headers, or in dumpfile headers created by the Fujitsu
    "sadump" facility.  In that case, the "bt" command will dump the x86 or
    x86_64 user-space register set.
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to handle cases where the shutdown NMI was
    received when a task had just received an interrupt, but before it had
    created a full exception frame on the kernel stack and called the
    interrupt handler.  Without the patch, the backtrace would be proceeded
    with the error message "bt: cannot resolve stack trace", display the trace
    without the kernel-entry exception frame, and then dump the text symbols
    found on the stack and all possible exception frames.
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to handle cases where the shutdown NMI was
    received when a task was in the act of being switched to.  Without the
    patch, the backtrace would be proceeded with the error message "bt: cannot
    resolve stack trace", display the trace without the kernel-entry exception
    frame, and then dump the text symbols found on the stack and all possible
    exception frames.

crash (5.1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.1.5 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fixed several typos in the updated crash.8 man page.
  * Created a new "rd -a" option that displays printable ASCII data only,
    starting from the specified location.  If a "count" argument is not
    entered, the display stops upon encountering the first non-printable
    character.
  * Fix for the "search -k" option on X86 kernels whose first memmap page
    structure does not map to physical address 0.  Without the patch, the
    identity-mapped region of the first memory node would not be searched.
  * Fix for the "search -k" option in the highly unlikely case of kernels that
    have multiple NUMA nodes that are not sequential with respect to their
    node IDs and the physical memory they reference, have physical memory
    holes between any of the nodes, and do not have memmap page structures
    referencing the non-existent inter-node physical memory.  In that event,
    it is conceivable that a NUMA node would be skipped.
  * If the "kmem <address>" argument is a virtual address inside a kernel
    module, the first item displayed is the address, followed by its symbol
    type, and its symbol-name-plus-offset string.  This patch appends the
    module name in brackets, similar to what is displayed if "sym <address>"
    is entered.
  * Fix for "kmem -s <address>" in kernels configured with CONFIG_SLUB and
    CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED if the address is contained in a page other than
    the first page in a compound, multi-page, slab.  Without the patch, the
    command would fail with the message "kmem: address is not allocated in
    slab subsystem: <address>".
  * Created a new "rd -N" option that displays 16- and 32-bit data in network
    byte order, performing byte-swapping if appropriate.
  * Fix for a compiler warning when building with "make warn".  Without the
    patch, memory.c generates a message indicating "kernel.c: In function
    ‘back_trace’:" followed by 17 messages indicating "kernel.c: 2187:
    warning: ‘btsave.<member>’ may be used uninitialized in this function",
    where there is one message for each <member> of the bt_info structure.
  * Updated the #define of NR_SECTION_ROOTS to match its change upstream that
    prevents its value from being calculated to be zero.
  * Fix for a double-free() in the unlikely event of a readmem() failure in
    the ARM architecture's read_module_unwind_table() function.
  * Updates to support CONFIG_SPARSEMEM for the ARM architecture.
  * Extended the "mach" command to display the size and address of each
    per-cpu IRQ stack and per-cpu exception stack, if they exist.  This
    extension is applicable to the x86_64 and ppc64 architectures, and the x86
    architecture if applicable.  Prior to this patch, the values were only
    accessible via "help -t" or "help -m".
  * Created a new "kmem -o" option that dumps each cpu's offset value that is
    added to per-cpu symbol values to translate them into kernel virtual
    addresses.  Prior to this patch, the values were only accessible via "help
    -k".
  * Removed the "kmem [-[l|L][a|i]]" options from being advertised by the
    "kmem" help page; the options have been obsolete since the Linux version
    2.2 timeframe.
  * Fix to support Linux 3.x version number change.  Without the patch, the
    crash session fails with kernel version 3.0 and later, displaying the
    message "WARNING: kernel version inconsistency between vmlinux and [live
    memory or dumpfile]", followed by the fatal error message "crash:
    incompatible arguments: vmlinux is not SMP -- [live system or dumpfile] is
    SMP".
  * Updates to the sial.c extension module to support the Linux 3.x version
    number change.
  * Created a new "kmem -g [flags]" option that displays the enumerator value
    of bits in the page structure's "flags" field.  With no "flags" argument,
    the enumerator value of all bits are displayed; when a hexadecimal "flags"
    option is added, just the bits in the value are translated.  This option
    only works with 2.6.26 and later kernels, which contain the "enum
    pageflags".

crash (5.1.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.1.5 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix to allow a vmlinux.bz2 file to be accepted when it is part of a
    relative or absolute pathname.  Without the patch, the file is rejected
    with the message "crash: <path-to>/vmlinux.bz2: not a supported file
    format", although it is still possible to use it with the "-f" flag.
  * Fix for the usage of a vmlinux.gz or vmlinux.bz2 file if the relevant
    gunzip or bunzip2 file is not located in /usr/bin.  Without the patch on
    an Ubunutu system, the uncompression fails because those binaries are only
    located in the /bin directory.  Also fixed the uncompression error message
    to differentiate between gunzip and bunzip2.
  * Created a new exist_regs_in_elf_notes() function for extension modules to
    pre-determine whether an ELF note containing registers exists for a
    specified task.  The function is also used by the currently-existing
    get_regs_from_elf_notes() function to clean up redundant code in the
    various get_<arch>_regs_from_elf_notes() functions that it calls.
  * Exported the formerly static x86_64_exception_frame() function to
    extension modules, and created a new EFRAME_INIT flags argument that
    directs the function to fill in the x86_64 pt_regs offset table and return
    any errors encountered in doing so.
  * Created and exported a new get_kvm_register_set() interface for extension
    modules to get a copy of the per-cpu registers stored in the kvmdump
    header.
  * Fix for the handling of x86_64 compressed kdump dumpfiles where the
    crashing system contained more than 454 cpus.  Without the patch, the
    crash session fails during initialization with the error message "crash:
    compressed kdump: invalid nr_cpus value: <cpus>" followed by "crash:
    vmcore: not a supported file format".
  * Fix for the "uvtop" and "vm -p" commands when run on tasks that have
    performed an mprotect(PROT_NONE) on a user-space page.  Because the
    PAGE_PRESENT bit is not set in that case, the page was presumed to be
    swapped out.  Without the patch the "vtop <address>" command fails with
    the error message "vtop: cannot determine swap location", and "vm -p"
    indicates "SWAP: (unknown swap location)" when iterating over the page.
  * Fix for the use of the "-g vmlinux" command line option by non-root users
    if the /dev/crash module has been preloaded.  Without the patch, after the
    vmlinux file's debugging information has been shown, the error messages
    "ERROR: Removing 'crash': Operation not permitted" and "NOTE:
    cleanup_memory_driver failed" are displayed.
  * Fix for the s390x "bt" command to handle a program check interrupt while
    operating on the process stack.  Without the patch, the backtrace stops
    prematurely upon reaching the pgm_check_handler() interrupt handler.
  * Long overdue rewrite of the crash.8 man page and the associated "crash -h"
    built-in usage display.  The crash.8 man page clarifies the required
    invocation options, adds all of the rarely-used command line options that
    have proliferated over the years, and updates the ENVIRONMENT variables
    section.  The "crash -h" output closely mimics the relevant parts of the
    crash.8 man page.
  * Fix for the embedded gdb module to determine member offsets of the
    pglist_data structure when the kernel was compiled with gcc 4.6.0.
    Without the patch, the system MEMORY size shown by the initial system data
    and by the "sys" command is nonsensical, the "kmem -n" command shows
    faulty memory node data, and if the kernel is configure with CONFIG_SLUB,
    "kmem -[sS]" will fail with numerous "kmem: page_to_nid: cannot determine
    node for pages: <page-address>" errors.  There may be other ramifications
    given that the pglist_data structure is crucial to the functionality of
    the crash utility.  
  * Implemented the capability of using the NT_PRSTATUS ELF note data that is
    saved in version 4 compressed kdump headers to determine the starting
    stack and instruction pointer hooks for x86 and x86_64 backtraces when
    they cannot be determined in the traditional manners.
  * Added a new "--osrelease <dumpfile>" command line option that displays the
    OSRELEASE vmcoreinfo string from a kdump dumpfile.
  * Fix to recognize the per-cpu symbol name change from "cpu_info" to
    "ia64_cpu_info" in 2.6.33 and later ia64 kernels.  Without the patch, the
    message "WARNING: cannot find cpuinfo_ia64 location" would appear during
    invocation, and the "mach -c" command would fail in a similar manner,
    indicating "mach: cannot find cpuinfo_ia64 location". 
  * Fix for "kmem -[sS]" command on 2.6.39 kernels where the original slab
    structure members have been moved into an anonymous union.  Without the
    patch, either command fails immediately with the error message "kmem:
    invalid structure member offset: slab_list".

crash (5.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.1.4 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for RT kernels in which the schedule() function has become a wrapper
    function that calls the  __schedule() function, and where other functions
    may call __schedule() directly.  Without the patch, a warning message
    indicating "crash: cannot determing thread return address" is displayed
    during invocation on x86_64 machines, and backtraces of blocked tasks may
    have missing or invalid frames.
  * Fix for running against live x86 kernels that were configured with
    CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START containing a value that is greater than its
    CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN value, and where the first symbol listed by
    /proc/kallsyms is not "_text".  Without the patch, the crash session fails
    during invocation with the error message "crash: vmlinux and /dev/mem do
    not match!" (or "/dev/crash" if applicable).  As a work- around,
    "/proc/kallsyms" can be entered on the command line, or the
    "--reloc=<size>" option could be used, but the fix obviates that
    requirement for live systems.  It should be noted that dumpfiles of
    kernels configured that way still do require that "/proc/kallsyms", or a
    copy of it, or alternatively the "--reloc=<size>" option, to be entered on
    the command line, as detailed in this changelog entry:
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog.html#4_0_4_5
  * Unlike other extension modules, the "sial.so" module must be built within
    a pre-built crash source tree because it uses header files from the
    embedded gdb module.  Therefore if a crash source tree is laid down,
    entered, and "make extensions" is entered without first building the crash
    utility, the build of sial.so build spews numerous error messages.  To
    avoid that, the sial.mk file has been modified to check whether the
    embedded gdb build has been completed, and if it has not, just displays
    "sial.so: build failed: requires the crash gdb-7.0 module".
  * If an extension module does not have its own <module>.mk file, and is
    built using the extensions/Makefile, then it will be compiled with the
    -Wall flag.
  * The "trace.so" extension module has been improved to use "trace.cmd" to
    implement the "trace show" option, instead of maintaining a redundant code
    base within the module itself.  The trace-cmd command is better, mature,
    and continually maintained.  The new "trace show" option works like so:
    (1) builds trace.dat from the core file and dumps it to /tmp.  (2) execs
    "trace-cmd report" upon the trace.dat file.  (3) splices the output of
    trace-cmd to the user and unlinks the temporary file.
  * Updates to the "trace.so" extension module to extract trace_bprintk()
    formats from a kernel core dump.  It handles both the current format and a
    new format that will be pushed out after the merge window has closed for
    Linux 2.6.40.  The new format is required for the kernel debugfs to export
    the same bprintk data as well.  This means that the trace.so extension
    module will be able to extract more information than trace-cmd itself can
    on a running kernel.
  * Fix for the "gdb" command, or any command that resolves to a gdb command,
    to not strip quotation marks from the input line.  Without the patch, any
    gdb command whose arguments contain quotation marks, (e.g. "printf") would
    fail because they get incorrectly stripped from the input line. 
  * Fix for the "p" command if its symbolic argument is a "char *" that points
    to a static data string containing an "%" character.  Without the patch,
    the command results in a segmentation violation.
  * Fix for the "sys -c" option to display an error message if a known
    sys_call_table entry is not a valid system call address.  Without the
    patch, the compromised system call entry is not displayed unless the crash
    debug mode is set to 1 or greater.  With the patch, the system call number
    will be followed by an error message indicating "invalid sys_call_table
    entry: <address> (<symbol-name>)".  This change is only applicable on
    architectures/kernels where the index of the sys_call_table array can be
    confirmed by debuginfo data, i.e., is not a loose calculation based upon
    the next kernel symbol.
  * Print a warning message if there is any inconsistency between the kernel
    version strings found in the vmlinux file vs. the dumpfile or live memory.
    If a System.map file is used to correct the virtual addresses found in the
    vmlinux file, the message is not displayed.
  * Fix for "kmem -v", and all other commands that search through the kernel's
    mapped virtual address list, in x86_64 kernel versions from 2.6.0 to
    2.6.11.  Those kernels contained a "vmlist" and a separate "mod_vmlist"
    list header, both of which point to list of vm_structs that described each
    contiguous block of mapped kernel memory.  2.6.12 and later x86_64 kernels
    consolidated both lists onto the "vmlist".  Without the patch, the list
    headed by "mod_vmlist" was not searched.
  * Clarify the "struct -l offset" option so that it does not imply that the
    address argument is necessarily an embedded list_head pointer.  The "-l
    offset" option essentially provides the capability of the kernel's
    container_of() macro, such that the address of an embedded data structure
    can be used to display its containing data structure.
  * Clarify the help page documentation for the "struct -l offset" option so
    that it does not imply that the address argument is necessarily an
    embedded list_head pointer.  The "-l offset" option essentially provides
    the capability of the kernel's container_of() macro, such that the address
    of an embedded data structure can be used to display its containing data
    structure.

 -- Troy Heber <troyh@debian.org>  Fri, 01 Apr 2011 09:58:11 -0600

crash (5.1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented support for using vmlinux files that have been compressed with
    either gzip or bzip2.  For examples:
              # crash vmlinux.gz vmcore
              # crash vmlinuz.bz2
    The uncompressed file will be temporarily stored either in /var/tmp or in
    the directory specified in a TMPDIR shell environment variable.  The
    compressed filename must at least begin with "vmlinux" so as to avoid any
    attempt to uncompress a vmcore file.  Gzip'd vmlinux files are preferable
    since the uncompress operation is less time-consuming.
  * Prevent an unnecessary warning message that was introduced in version
    5.1.0 that indicates "WARNING: cannot read .debug_frame data from
    <namelist>" when running against vmlinux executables that have a separate
    ".debug" debuginfo file, such as RHEL3 vmlinux kernels.  With the patch,
    the message is only printed if CRASHDEBUG(1).
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command if the shutdown NMI is issued to a 32-bit
    task that has executed a "sysenter" instruction and the RSP still contains
    the zero value loaded from the MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP register.  Without
    the patch, the backtrace issues a warning message indicating "WARNING:
    possibly bogus exception frame", and is unable to make a transition from
    the NMI exception stack.
  * Fixes for the gdb-7.0 sources to address gcc-4.6 compile failures.
    Without the patch, gcc-4.6 generates "error: variable ‘<variable>’ set but
    not used [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" fatal errors when the
    (default) -Werror flag is used.  Previous gcc versions considered local
    variables were simply set to some value to be "used", but that is no
    longer the case.
  * Fixes for the top-level crash sources to address gcc-4.6 compiler warnings
    or errors.  Without the patch, building with gcc-4.6 would generate
    numerous "error: variable ‘<variable>’ set but not used
    [-Werror=unused-but-set-variable]" errors or warnings, depending upon
    whether "make warn" or "make Warn" was used.
  * Removed -Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 from the WARNING_OPTIONS string due to a
    memmove() oddity seen when using it in conjunction with -O2 with gcc-4.6.
  * Implemented three new options for the "search" command.  This patch adds
    the -c option to search for character strings, the -w option to search for
    unsigned hexadecimal integer values, and -h to search for unsigned
    hexadecimal short values.   The integer and short values are searched on
    integer and short alignments respectively.  The -w option is only
    meaningful on 64-bit systems, to be used in order to search both the upper
    and lower 32-bits of each 64-bit long for the 32-bit value.  Strings are
    searched across contiguous page boundaries, where the page boundaries
    being crossed are relevant to the memory type being searched, i.e., kernel
    virtual, user virtual, or physical memory. 
  * Restrict the new "search -p" option to physical memory pages that have an
    mem_map page structure assigned to them. 
  * Hardwire the declaration of the user_regs_struct in x86_64.c for kernels
    whose debuginfo data does not contain it.
  * Fix for compiler warnings when building makedumpfile.c and memory.c with
    "make warn" on 32-bit systems.
  * Fix to more correctly determine the KVM I/O hole size and location.  The
    I/O hole size to this point in time is either 1GB or 512MB, but its
    setting is hardwired into the Qemu code that was used to create the
    dumpfile.  The dumpfile is a "savevm" file that is designed to be used for
    guest migration, and since inter-version save/load is not supported, the
    I/O hole information does not have to encoded into the dumpfile.  Without
    the patch, the I/O hole for dumpfiles created by older Qemu version was
    not being set to 1GB, so if the KVM guest was configured with more than
    3GB of memory, the crash session would typically display numerous "read
    error" messages during session initialization.
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command on RHEL6 kernels that contain a backport of
    upstream commit a00e817f42663941ea0aa5f85a9d1c4f8b212839, which moved x86
    irq-exit functions to a special .kprobes.text section.  Without this
    patch, "bt" would show nonsensical backtraces that begin and end with the
    "ia32_sysenter_target" function, and would dump an invalid kernel-entry
    exception frame.
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to fix a possible failure to backtrace a
    non-active "swapper" task.  Without the patch, the backtrace would fail
    with the error message "bt: cannot resolve stack trace".
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to prevent the display of a stale interrupt
    exception frame left on the stack of a non-active task.

crash (5.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.1.1 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for the potential to miss tasks when walking the pid_hash table in
    2.6.24 and later kernels.
  * Enhancement for the ARM architecture's "bt" command  to print out the user
    space register set for tasks entering the kernel via the syscall entry
    point. 
  * Rework of the handling of "set" commands that are put in .crashrc files so
    that only the following options are resolved prior to session
    initialization: silent, console, core, edit, namelist, and zero_excluded.
    All others are resolved immediately after session initialization is
    complete.  Accordingly, the use of "set -c <cpu>", "set -p", "set -a
    [task|pid]" and set [pid|task]" are now acceptable .crashrc commands.
  * The entering of "set -v" in a .crashrc file would cause an immediate
    segmentation violation.  The "set" command rework above defers the command
    until session initialization is complete.
  * The entering of "set dumpfile <filename>" in a .crashrc file would cause a
    fatal "seek" error during session initalization with most most dumpfile
    types, so the "dumpfile" option has been removed from the "set" command.
  * The execution of "alias" commands from a .crashrc file used to be
    performed immediately; that behavior has been changed so that they are
    executed immediately after session initialization is complete.
  * Enhancement of the "repeat" command to allow command aliases.
  * Fix for running "kmem -s" on a live system if an offline cpu is brought
    back online while the command is executing.  Without the patch, the online
    operation may cause a segmentation violation.
  * Change the behavior of "bt -[tT]" to allow the command options to be run
    on active tasks on live systems.  Without the patch, both command options
    would display the task data banner followed by "(active)".  
  * Fix for the ARM architecuture's "irq" command when run on 2.6.36 and later
    kernels.  Without the patch, the command fails with the error message
    "irq: invalid kernel virtual address: 23  type: irq_chip typename".   The
    fix replaces the custom ARM IRQ dumping function with the
    architecture-neutral version.
  * Introduced support for using /proc/kcore as an alternative source of live
    memory to /dev/mem.  Doing so allows vmalloc memory access on 32-bit
    architectures when the underlying mapped physical memory is in highmem,
    which is not allowed by the /dev/mem driver.  It would also be usable on
    systems that are configured with CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM but still configured
    with CONFIG_PROC_KCORE.  To enforce the use of /proc/kcore, it may be
    entered on the command line.
  * If a live crash session attempts to use /dev/mem as a live memory source,
    and it is determined that the system is configured with
    CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM, /proc/kcore will automatically be tried as an
    alternative.  
  * Fix to allow "/dev/crash" to be entered on the command line for live
    sessions.  Because it is used automatically if it exists, it is never
    necessary to enter it on the command line.  However, if it is used,
    without the patch, the session fails during initializaion with the error
    message "crash: /dev/crash: No such file or directory" if the crash.ko
    driver is a module (RHEL4/RHEL5), or "crash: /dev/crash: not a supported
    file format" if the driver is built into the kernel (RHEL6).
  * Fix for the ARM "bt" command to address the issue behind faulty warning
    messages that indicate "WARNING: UNWIND: unsupported personality routine".
  * Fix for the ARM "bt" command to address the issue behind faulty warning
    messages that indicate "bt: WARNING: UNWIND: cannot find index for

crash (5.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.7 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Introduction of ARM processor support for the crash utility. 
  * Fix to support KVM dumpfiles that have "ram" device header sections with a
    version_id of 4. 
  * Fix for KVM dumpfiles from guests that were provisioned with more than
    3.5GB of RAM. 
  * Minor fix to memory.c to address a compiler warning when building with
    "make warn", or a compiler failure when using "make Warn".
  * Fix for a segmentation violation caused by the "mount" command in the rare
    circumstance where the "init" task (pid 1) does not exist.
  * CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT x86_64 realtime kernels allocate only 3 exception stacks
    to handle the 5 possible exception types, and therefore the same per-cpu
    stack may be used for different exception types.  This could cause "bt"
    output that contained exception stack name strings to be incorrect.  The
    patch displays all exception stack name strings in RT kernels to all show
    "RT", as in "--- <RT exception stack> ---".
  * Fix for the potential to miss one or more tasks in 2.6.23 and earlier
    kernels, presumably due to catching an entry the kernel's pid_hash[] chain
    in transition.  Without the patch, the task will simply not be seen in the
    gathered task list.
  * Fix to correct a presumption that the kernel's task_state_array[] is NULL
    terminated.

crash (5.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.6 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for support of xendump and Xen kdump dumpfiles from 2.6.27 and and
    later x86_64 kernels. 
  * Fix for the "s390dbf" command to allow the command's output to be
    redirected to a pipe. 
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to generically recognize the end of trace
    condition for tasks entering the kernel from user-space without having to
    hardwire any more kernel entry point function names.  Without the patch, a
    task that took a clock interrupt from user-space and crashed while
    operating on the soft IRQ stack failed with the error message "bt: cannot
    resolve stack trace". (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Display the "machine type mismatch" warning when attempting to use a ppc64
    vmlinux file on a non-ppc64 64-bit host.  Without the patch, the fact that
    ppc64 vmlinux ELF files are type ET_DYN, and not type ET_EXEC like all of
    the other architectures, was allowing the vmlinux to be accepted without
    the mismatch warning, and would subsequently fail without a meaningful
    explanation being displayed.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command if the kdump-generated NMI interrupts a
    multi-threaded task that has just entered kernel space but has not changed
    the RSP stack pointer register from its user-space per-thread stack
    location to the kernel stack.  Without the patch, the command follows the
    display of the exception frame on the NMI exception stack with the message
    "WARNING: possibly bogus exception frame", displays the error message "bt:
    cannot transition from exception stack to current process stack", and does
    not display the user-space exception frame.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Added the "set" command to the list of commands acceptable when running
    in --minimal mode.  The command is limited to the setting of internal
    variables since there is no task context in that mode.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the "vtop" command when run against x86 Xen PAE kernels.  Without
    the patch, the "PAGE:" displays (machine and pseudo-physical) contained
    non-zero values in the lower 12 bits, and the translation of the PTE entry
    was incorrect as a result of receiving the incorrect contents in the lower
    12-bits of the PTE entry.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for running against live x86_64 pv_ops/Xen guest
    kernels.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for xendump ELF dumpfiles generated from x86_64
    pvops/Xen guest kernels.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for running against live x86 pv_ops/Xen guest kernels.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for xendump ELF dumpfiles generated from x86 pvops/Xen
    guest kernels.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Determine the bit positions of PG_reserved and PG_slab using the newer
    pageflags enumerator values if available.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix to prevent the "repeat" command from keeping a crash session alive if
    the controlling terminal session is killed.  (anderson@redhat.com)

crash (5.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.5 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Implemented a new "bt -F" flag as an extension of the "bt -f" flag.
  * Fix for the %install stanza in the crash.spec file to check for the
    existence of the sial.so extension module.
  *  Minor correction to the error message displayed by the "crash -x" command
     line option when the pre-loading of an extension module fails.
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" and "bt -E" commands if the kdump-generated NMI
    interrupts a task that has just entered kernel space but has not changed
    the RSP stack pointer register from its user-space location to the kernel
    stack.
  * Fix for compiler warnings when building "net.c" with -O2.
  * Fix for a compiler warning when building "gdb_interface.c" with -O2
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command if the crash occurs during the execution of a
    kernel module's init_module() function.
  * Fix to support newer KVM dumpfile format generated by "virsh dump" that
    may contain "block" and "kvmclock" devices in the dumpfile header.
  * Fix for "kmem -[sS]" command on 2.6.34 and later CONFIG_SLUB kernels,
    which changed the kmem_cache.cpu_slab[NR_CPUS] array to be a per-cpu
    offset value.
  * Modified the "kmem -p" output to show the "INDEX" column values with a
    hexadecimal value because the "page.index" member is typically a
    shared-use field that may also contain a pointer value.
  * Addressed compiler warnings generated by net.c when built with -O2.
  * Fix for the "kmem <address>" command if the kernel's free page lists are
    corrupt, or in a state of flux, and cannot be followed.
  * Fix to read KVM dumpfiles generated by the "virsh dump" of a RHEL5 guest
    from a RHEL6 host, and to support dumpfile format changes that contain
    "apic" and "__rhel5" devices.

crash (5.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.4 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command when a newly-forked task's resumption EIP
    address value is set to the "ret_from_fork" entry point by copy_thread().
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command if the kdump-generated NMI interrupts a task
    running in kernel space at a point in the system_call entry point code
    prior to the call to a system call function.
  * Fix for the "bt" command on 2.6.29 and later x86_64 kernels to recognize
    and display exception frames generated by exceptions that do not result in
    a stack switch, such as general protection faults.
  * The kernel patch for ppc64 CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP kernels that stores
    vmemmap page mapping information so that the crash utility is able to
    translate vmemmap'd kernel virtual addresses has been updated.
  * Fix the error message for the "dev -p" comand when run on 2.6.26 or later
    kernels, which no longer have the global "pci_devices" list head.
  * If a cpu in an s390 or s390x dumpfile is offline, and the "bt" command
    receives a backtrace request for the "swapper" task on that cpu, the
    command will display "CPU offline".
  * Fix for 2.6.34 and later x86_64 kernels which generate per-cpu symbols of
    type 'd' or type 'D' instead of type 'V'.
  * Fix to prevent a segmentation violation during initialization in the
    x86_64_get_active_set() function by verifying that the array of current
    tasks in machdep->machspec->current[] has actually been allocated.
  * Fix to support KVM dumpfiles created with "virsh dump" that create "cpu"
    header sections using a QEMU CPU_SAVE_VERSION version greater than the
    supported version of 9.
  * Fix for x86_64 KVM dumpfiles created with "virsh dump" whose kernels have
    a "_text" virtual address higher than __START_KERNEL_map.
  * Implemented a new "map" command that is seen only when running with KVM
    guest dumpfiles created with "virsh dump".
  * Fix for an incorrect calculation of the physical base address of a
    fully-virtualized x86_64 RHEL6 guest kernel running on a RHEL5 Xen host.
  * Fix for the "bt" command on inactive (blocked) tasks on 2.6.33 and later
    x86_64 kernels, which have the "thread_return" symbol removed from the
    embedded "switch_to" macro.
  * Fix for the "bt" command on 2.6.33 and later x86 kernels, which moved the
    "system_call" assembly function to the .kprobes.text section.
  * Fix for a segmentation violation caused by the "extensions/trace.c"
    extension module, as seen when running the "trace show -c <cpu>" command
    from that module.
  * Implemented a "trace dump -t" command for the "extensions/trace.c"

crash (5.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.3 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for running against 2.6.34 and later kernels to recognize and handle
    changes in the kernel's per-cpu data symbol naming, which no longer
    prefixes "per_cpu__" to declared per-cpu symbol names.
  * Fix for "swap" and "kmem -i" commands on 2.6.29 or later, big-endian,

    when used on an x86 machine with a single PT_LOAD segment that starts at a
    non-zero address.
  * Fixes for several bugs in the s390 and s390x stack backtrace code
  * Fix for the "mach -m" command option on x86 or x86_64 systems whose
    BIOS-provided e820 map contains EFI-related memory type value that has not
    been mapped to an E820 type (pre-2.6.27), or if the type is E820_UNUSABLE
    (2.6.28 and later). 
  * Fix for SIAL extension module if a script uses structures that contain
    members of type "bool".
  * Fix to prevent a stream of harmless but annoying error messages when
    running "crash -d4" (or any larger -d debug value) on x86 machines.  
  * Fix for the "kmem -s list" command option on non-CONFIG_SLUB kernels that
    contain a "cache_chain" list_head symbol instead of having a "#define
    cache_chain (cache_cache.next)" construct.
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command to recognize, and take advantage of,
    kernels that were built with CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER.
  * Fix to prevent a crash session that is run over a network connection that
    is killed/removed from going into 100% cpu-time loop.
  * Change the output of "ps -t" to display the task_struct's utime and stime
    values unmodified on kernels using a cputime_t (unsigned long) to store
    those values.
  *  Fix for the x86 "bt" command if the kdump-generated NMI interrupts a

     frame (pt_regs) gets written on the kernel stack.
  *  Fix for the "bt -e" command on 2.6.30 or later x86 kernels if the x86.c
