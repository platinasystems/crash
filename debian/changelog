crash (5.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.6 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for support of xendump and Xen kdump dumpfiles from 2.6.27 and and
    later x86_64 kernels. 
  * Fix for the "s390dbf" command to allow the command's output to be
    redirected to a pipe. 
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command to generically recognize the end of trace
    condition for tasks entering the kernel from user-space without having to
    hardwire any more kernel entry point function names.  Without the patch, a
    task that took a clock interrupt from user-space and crashed while
    operating on the soft IRQ stack failed with the error message "bt: cannot
    resolve stack trace". (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Display the "machine type mismatch" warning when attempting to use a ppc64
    vmlinux file on a non-ppc64 64-bit host.  Without the patch, the fact that
    ppc64 vmlinux ELF files are type ET_DYN, and not type ET_EXEC like all of
    the other architectures, was allowing the vmlinux to be accepted without
    the mismatch warning, and would subsequently fail without a meaningful
    explanation being displayed.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command if the kdump-generated NMI interrupts a
    multi-threaded task that has just entered kernel space but has not changed
    the RSP stack pointer register from its user-space per-thread stack
    location to the kernel stack.  Without the patch, the command follows the
    display of the exception frame on the NMI exception stack with the message
    "WARNING: possibly bogus exception frame", displays the error message "bt:
    cannot transition from exception stack to current process stack", and does
    not display the user-space exception frame.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Added the "set" command to the list of commands acceptable when running
    in --minimal mode.  The command is limited to the setting of internal
    variables since there is no task context in that mode.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix for the "vtop" command when run against x86 Xen PAE kernels.  Without
    the patch, the "PAGE:" displays (machine and pseudo-physical) contained
    non-zero values in the lower 12 bits, and the translation of the PTE entry
    was incorrect as a result of receiving the incorrect contents in the lower
    12-bits of the PTE entry.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for running against live x86_64 pv_ops/Xen guest
    kernels.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for xendump ELF dumpfiles generated from x86_64
    pvops/Xen guest kernels.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for running against live x86 pv_ops/Xen guest kernels.
    (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Implemented support for xendump ELF dumpfiles generated from x86 pvops/Xen
    guest kernels.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Determine the bit positions of PG_reserved and PG_slab using the newer
    pageflags enumerator values if available.  (anderson@redhat.com)
  * Fix to prevent the "repeat" command from keeping a crash session alive if
    the controlling terminal session is killed.  (anderson@redhat.com)

crash (5.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.5 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Implemented a new "bt -F" flag as an extension of the "bt -f" flag.
  * Fix for the %install stanza in the crash.spec file to check for the
    existence of the sial.so extension module.
  *  Minor correction to the error message displayed by the "crash -x" command
     line option when the pre-loading of an extension module fails.
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" and "bt -E" commands if the kdump-generated NMI
    interrupts a task that has just entered kernel space but has not changed
    the RSP stack pointer register from its user-space location to the kernel
    stack.
  * Fix for compiler warnings when building "net.c" with -O2.
  * Fix for a compiler warning when building "gdb_interface.c" with -O2
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command if the crash occurs during the execution of a
    kernel module's init_module() function.
  * Fix to support newer KVM dumpfile format generated by "virsh dump" that
    may contain "block" and "kvmclock" devices in the dumpfile header.
  * Fix for "kmem -[sS]" command on 2.6.34 and later CONFIG_SLUB kernels,
    which changed the kmem_cache.cpu_slab[NR_CPUS] array to be a per-cpu
    offset value.
  * Modified the "kmem -p" output to show the "INDEX" column values with a
    hexadecimal value because the "page.index" member is typically a
    shared-use field that may also contain a pointer value.
  * Addressed compiler warnings generated by net.c when built with -O2.
  * Fix for the "kmem <address>" command if the kernel's free page lists are
    corrupt, or in a state of flux, and cannot be followed.
  * Fix to read KVM dumpfiles generated by the "virsh dump" of a RHEL5 guest
    from a RHEL6 host, and to support dumpfile format changes that contain
    "apic" and "__rhel5" devices.

crash (5.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.4 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command when a newly-forked task's resumption EIP
    address value is set to the "ret_from_fork" entry point by copy_thread().
  * Fix for the x86 "bt" command if the kdump-generated NMI interrupts a task
    running in kernel space at a point in the system_call entry point code
    prior to the call to a system call function.
  * Fix for the "bt" command on 2.6.29 and later x86_64 kernels to recognize
    and display exception frames generated by exceptions that do not result in
    a stack switch, such as general protection faults.
  * The kernel patch for ppc64 CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP kernels that stores
    vmemmap page mapping information so that the crash utility is able to
    translate vmemmap'd kernel virtual addresses has been updated.
  * Fix the error message for the "dev -p" comand when run on 2.6.26 or later
    kernels, which no longer have the global "pci_devices" list head.
  * If a cpu in an s390 or s390x dumpfile is offline, and the "bt" command
    receives a backtrace request for the "swapper" task on that cpu, the
    command will display "CPU offline".
  * Fix for 2.6.34 and later x86_64 kernels which generate per-cpu symbols of
    type 'd' or type 'D' instead of type 'V'.
  * Fix to prevent a segmentation violation during initialization in the
    x86_64_get_active_set() function by verifying that the array of current
    tasks in machdep->machspec->current[] has actually been allocated.
  * Fix to support KVM dumpfiles created with "virsh dump" that create "cpu"
    header sections using a QEMU CPU_SAVE_VERSION version greater than the
    supported version of 9.
  * Fix for x86_64 KVM dumpfiles created with "virsh dump" whose kernels have
    a "_text" virtual address higher than __START_KERNEL_map.
  * Implemented a new "map" command that is seen only when running with KVM
    guest dumpfiles created with "virsh dump".
  * Fix for an incorrect calculation of the physical base address of a
    fully-virtualized x86_64 RHEL6 guest kernel running on a RHEL5 Xen host.
  * Fix for the "bt" command on inactive (blocked) tasks on 2.6.33 and later
    x86_64 kernels, which have the "thread_return" symbol removed from the
    embedded "switch_to" macro.
  * Fix for the "bt" command on 2.6.33 and later x86 kernels, which moved the
    "system_call" assembly function to the .kprobes.text section.
  * Fix for a segmentation violation caused by the "extensions/trace.c"
    extension module, as seen when running the "trace show -c <cpu>" command
    from that module.
  * Implemented a "trace dump -t" command for the "extensions/trace.c"
    extension module.

crash (5.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 5.0.3 (see
    http://people.redhat.com/anderson/crash.changelog)
  * Fix for running against 2.6.34 and later kernels to recognize and handle
    changes in the kernel's per-cpu data symbol naming, which no longer
    prefixes "per_cpu__" to declared per-cpu symbol names.
  * Fix for "swap" and "kmem -i" commands on 2.6.29 or later, big-endian,
    ppc64 kernels, where the swap_info_struct.flags member was changed from an
    int to a long.
  * Fix for the "vm" and "ps" command's task RSS value on 2.6.34 or later
    kernels.

    when used on an x86 machine with a single PT_LOAD segment that starts at a
    non-zero address.

  * Fix for the "mach -m" command option on x86 or x86_64 systems whose
    BIOS-provided e820 map contains EFI-related memory type value that has not
    been mapped to an E820 type (pre-2.6.27), or if the type is E820_UNUSABLE
    (2.6.28 and later). 
  * Fix for SIAL extension module if a script uses structures that contain
    members of type "bool".
  * Fix to prevent a stream of harmless but annoying error messages when

  * Fix for the "kmem -s list" command option on non-CONFIG_SLUB kernels that
    contain a "cache_chain" list_head symbol instead of having a "#define
    cache_chain (cache_cache.next)" construct.
  * Fix for the x86_64 "bt" command to recognize, and take advantage of,
    kernels that were built with CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER.
  * Fix to prevent a crash session that is run over a network connection that
    is killed/removed from going into 100% cpu-time loop.
  * Change the output of "ps -t" to display the task_struct's utime and stime
    values unmodified on kernels using a cputime_t (unsigned long) to store
    those values.
  *  Fix for the x86 "bt" command if the kdump-generated NMI interrupts a
     process in kernel space at a pointer before the full user-mode exception
     frame (pt_regs) gets written on the kernel stack.
