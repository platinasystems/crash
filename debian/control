Description: kernel debugging utility, allowing gdb like syntax
 The core analysis suite is a self-contained tool that can be used to
 investigate either live systems, or multiple different core dump formats
 including kdump, LKCD, netdump and diskdump.
 .
 o  The tool is loosely based on the SVR4 crash command, but has been
    completely integrated with gdb in order to be able to display
    formatted kernel data structures, disassemble source code, etc.
 .
 o  The current set of available commands consist of common kernel core
    analysis tools such as a context-specific stack traces, source code
    disassembly, kernel variable displays, memory display, dumps of
    linked-lists, etc.  In addition, any gdb command may be entered,
    which in turn will be passed onto the gdb module for execution.
 .
 o  There are several commands that delve deeper into specific kernel
    subsystems, which also serve as templates for kernel developers
    to create new commands for analysis of a specific area of interest.
    Adding a new command is a simple affair, and a quick recompile
    adds it to the command menu.
 .
 o  The intent is to make the tool independent of Linux version dependencies,
    building in recognition of major kernel code changes so as to adapt to
    new kernel versions, while maintaining backwards compatibility.
